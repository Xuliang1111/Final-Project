# Final Project: Changes in Extreme Precipitation in Ohio River Basin
***
## 1. Scientific question
With the global warming, it is more and more likely to have extreme climate events around the world. A kind of amplification effect has been noted that even a small changes in mean values of precipitation may result in a relatively high increase in the probability of extreme precipitation, which makes the updated recogination of the extreme rainfall essential. One way to qualify "extreme" is through the the annual maximum as well as the threshold level. This project has chosen the Ohio basin to conduct research.

## 3. summary of the analysis

(1)Make a map of the change in the annual mean precipitation between 2000 and 2020

(2)Find and plot the annual maximum rainfall (1, 7 and 30 Days)

(3)Find and plot the annual threshold level(95th and 97.5 percentiles)
