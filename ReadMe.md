## 1. Scientific question
With the global warming, it is more and more likely to have extreme climate events around the world. A kind of amplification effect has been noted that even a small changes in mean values of precipitation may result in a relatively high increase in the probability of extreme precipitation, which makes the updated recogination of the extreme rainfall essential. One way to qualify "extreme" is through the the annual maximum as well as the threshold level. This project has chosen the Ohio River Basin to conduct research.

## 3. summary of the analysis

(1)Make maps of the change in the annual mean precipitation in 1964(before global warming) and 2020

(2)Find the precipitation patterns in Ohio River Basin

(3)Find and plot the Rainfall-Duration-Return Period curve(1, 7 and 30 Days)
